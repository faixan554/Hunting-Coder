The popularity and interest in the development of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/decentralized-finance-defi\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DeFi<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/non-fungible-tokens-nft\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NFTs<\/a>&nbsp;have spiked up the hype for web3 by huge margins. Developers, entrepreneurs, and product managers seek new opportunities for capitalizing on the opportunities available in this field. Therefore, the search for guides on&nbsp;web 3.0 for product managers&nbsp;has become a primary requirement for multiple aspiring professionals.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, you should have a clear impression of web3 and the products it offers before you take the decision to pursue a product management&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/web3-careers\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">career in web3<\/a>. The following discussion will offer you an outline of web3 basics and the products it offers, which could be useful for product managers. Most important of all, you can develop a clear impression of the requirements of product managers in web3.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Fundamentals of Web3<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Web3 started off as a term by the co-creator of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/ultimate-ethereum-guide\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ethereum<\/a>, Gavin Wood. The basic definition of web3 is essential for understanding the fundamentals of&nbsp;web3 product management&nbsp;as it could help in identifying the foundations on which you would work as a product manager. Web 3.0 is generally painted as the third generation of the internet with a revised emphasis on decentralized user experiences. Therefore, you can also consider web3 as the decentralized variant of the internet operating on the foundation of blockchain technology. It is also important to note that users are responsible for the development, operations, management, and ownership of the new version of the web3.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The curiosity regarding&nbsp;web3 product manager salary&nbsp;estimates would draw attention to the need for product management in web3. You can rely on a fundamental impression of the value of web3 with its benefits for validating the reasons to seek product management with web3. Here are some of the notable benefits you can discover with web3.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>True ownership of information data and transactions stored on&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/blockchain-technology-explained\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blockchain<\/a>&nbsp;networks.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Permissionless access to digital products and services.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Emphasis on&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DAOs or Decentralized Autonomous Organizations<\/a>&nbsp;for fuelling democracy and user participation in digital networks.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Censorship resistance enables better scope for a democratic approach to transactions and information exchange.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/digital-identity\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Decentralized digital identities<\/a>&nbsp;or DIDs can facilitate new perspectives on digital identity management alongside maintaining anonymity.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Enhanced privacy and security through&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/peer-to-peer-network\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">peer-to-peer networks<\/a>.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Build your identity as a certified blockchain expert with 101 Blockchains&rsquo;&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/certifications\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Blockchain Certifications<\/a>&nbsp;designed to provide enhanced career prospects.<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What Are the Products You Can Explore in Web3?<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The search for&nbsp;web3 product manager jobs&nbsp;would obviously create curiosity regarding the products you have to deal with in web3. As of now, you must have identified that web3 applications are developed on decentralized blockchain networks. What types of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/web3-use-cases\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">use cases do the applications of web3<\/a>&nbsp;serve in the real world? Let us take a look at some of the notable products and solutions you can explore with web3.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h4><strong>Cryptocurrencies and DeFi<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\t<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the clearly evident aspects of the roles of&nbsp;web3 product managers&nbsp;would focus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/what-is-cryptocurrency\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cryptocurrencies<\/a>&nbsp;and DeFi. These two solutions validate the impact of web3 on the domain of finance.&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/decentralized-finance-defi\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Decentralized finance, or DeFi<\/a>, is one of the top&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/uses-for-blockchain-technology\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">applications of blockchain<\/a>, which brings web3 to the front. DeFi transfers traditional financial services to blockchain networks to enable decentralized access to the services.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Users don&rsquo;t have to rely on centralized institutions or agents to access an open and transparent financial market. On the other hand, cryptocurrencies have also pointed out an exclusive solution in the web3 domain. Some of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/top-10-most-popular-cryptocurrencies\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">popular cryptocurrencies<\/a>, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/bitcoin-guide\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/ultimate-ethereum-guide\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ethereum<\/a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/stablecoins\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">stablecoins<\/a>, have prompted the development of many similar projects which need product managers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Want to learn and understand the scope and purpose of DeFi?

The focus of&nbsp;web3 product management&nbsp;on NFTs would primarily deal with the emergence of a creator economy.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Artists could use NFTs as a tool for monetizing their work while also leveraging the tools offered within the NFT ecosystem for building new&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/top-nft-collections\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NFTs or collections<\/a>&nbsp;to expand the creator economy. Non-fungible tokens have become one of the popular choices for investors in the web3 space as speculations around the projects could result in price improvements.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h4><strong>Decentralized Autonomous Organizations&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\t<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The next important product in the web3 landscape, which would be important for&nbsp;web3 product manager jobs,&nbsp;refers to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DAOs or Decentralized Autonomous Organizations<\/a>. People can use the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/top-web3-features\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">features of web3<\/a>&nbsp;for developing organizational entities, which could work without the intervention of central governing authorities. Some of the notable examples of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/top-dao-applications\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">applications of DAOs<\/a>&nbsp;include joint venture capital investments, fundraising,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/metaverse-technology\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">metaverse<\/a>&nbsp;administration, or any application which requires collaboration-based decision-making.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Aspiring to Become a Certified NFT Expert?

Is a product manager really necessary for web3 projects? Interestingly, the most important requirements for a web3 project do not have any association with product managers. For example, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/ultimate-ethereum-guide\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ethereum<\/a>&nbsp;Foundation does not have any dedicated project managers. Why?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the web3 projects, such as NFTs or&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/top-defi-protocols\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DeFi protocols<\/a>, could rely only on developers, community managers, protocol designers, and artists. However, web3 projects are ultimately producing some sort of product or service at the end of the day. Therefore, it is clearly evident that a product manager could serve significant value advantages. Here are some of the potential reasons why you might consider a product manager for web3 projects.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The engineering teams behind different existing and emerging web3 projects have invariably become large, relying solely on self-coordination. In such cases,&nbsp;web3 product managers&nbsp;can improve the efficiency of the projects.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The sheer variety of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/what-is-dapp\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dApps<\/a>, DeFi solutions, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/top-nft-collections\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NFT collections<\/a>&nbsp;can be overwhelming for uninitiated users. Product managers are essential for web3 projects which struggle with a complicated, consumer-facing UX or issues in gaining popularity with the target audience.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The search volume for queries like &ldquo;web3 product manager salary&rdquo; shows that product managers could address different activities which are beyond the reach of developers. For example, you cannot expect developers to deal with business development and marketing activities. In such cases, a versatile product manager could resolve the pressing needs for developing and expanding web3 projects.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Excited to learn the basic and advanced concepts of ethereum technology?

The answer to &ldquo;How do I become a product manager in Web3?&rdquo; would emphasize developing the responsibilities required for the job. Interestingly, the following outline of the responsibilities of a web3 product manager could help you identify the skills you need for the job.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Web3 project manager responsibilities\" src=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Web3-project-manager-responsibilities.png\" style=\"height:700px; width:700px\" \/><\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h4><strong>Priority for Execution<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\t<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Web3 emphasizes the need for product managers to pay attention to execution over establishing long-term vision or strategic goals. Product managers could have to come up with a technical specification with developers and implement QA best practices followed by creating&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/smart-contract-audit\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">smart contract audits<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the role of product managers would also emphasize launching web3 projects as quickly as possible. The fast pace of developments in the field of web3 can render vision and strategy statements obsolete within the course of a year. Therefore, web3 product management skills emphasize more on development, marketing, and repeating the process over planning, management, and measurement.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Want to know the real-world examples of smart contracts and understand how you can use it for your business? Check the presentation Now on&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/presentations\/examples-of-smart-contracts\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Examples Of Smart Contracts<\/a><\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h4><strong>Business Development Role<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\t<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The implications of&nbsp;web 3.0 for product managers&nbsp;also emphasize their role in growing web3 projects. Product managers can serve as vital support for addressing different requirements for the development of a web3 product or service beyond the technical aspects. Product managers have to assume multiple responsibilities as web3 does not favor the conventional structures followed in web2 organizations.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, the web3 product manager or PM might have to interact with the community, plan the UX, develop collaborations with&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/stablecoins\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">stablecoin<\/a>&nbsp;protocols or write posts for product launches. In the world of web3, only one person could take on the responsibility for addressing the interdependent technical tasks related to a specific project.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h4><strong>Emphasis on Perfection in Services<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\t<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Another crucial responsibility for product managers in the field of web3 reflects on achieving perfection in the existing solution rather than adding new features. For example, the popularity of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/bored-ape-yacht-club-nfts\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bored Ape Yacht Club<\/a>&nbsp;depends on the quality of the artwork, while a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DAO<\/a>&nbsp;is popular for the facility of easy setup.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Want to learn the basic and advanced concepts of Stablecoin?

Web3 makes it difficult to understand user behavior, especially with the privileges for users to maintain complete control over their data. In addition, user data in web3 is spread across multiple wallets and decentralized&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/blockchain-technology-explained\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blockchain<\/a>&nbsp;networks.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>How could product managers determine how people are utilizing their web3 product? Product managers in web3 would have to use qualitative information such as network information and user feedback to understand users. In addition, some products could also opt for bootstrapping communities through the facility of native tokens.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h4><strong>In-depth Knowledge of Blockchain Networks<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\t<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important highlight in answers to &ldquo;How do I become a product manager in Web3?&rdquo; points to the fluency in blockchain networks. You must have a comprehensive base of skills and knowledge regarding blockchain fundamentals. At the same time, you must also develop a technical understanding of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/blockchain-protocol\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blockchain protocols<\/a>&nbsp;such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/ultimate-ethereum-guide\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ethereum<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/solana-blockchain\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Solana<\/a>. It could help you identify the chains which could support the design of the concerned web3 project.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h4><strong>Skills in User Security<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\t<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The critical skills required for the job of web3 product manager would also focus on ensuring user security. Users need the assurance of proven security mechanisms to avoid any unwanted consequences. At the same time, it is practically impossible for all users to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/101blockchains.com\/smart-contract-audit\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">audit smart contracts<\/a>&nbsp;to identify security risks. Therefore, the product manager must take on the responsibility of ensuring the security of a web3 app.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Want to learn blockchain technology in detail?

Start by defining your role and career objectives with respect to the web3 project of your choice. Interact with the founder or core contributors with a convincing explanation about your skills.
